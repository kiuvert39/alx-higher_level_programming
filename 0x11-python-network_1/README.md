# Script Documentation: Handling HTTP Errors in Python

## Overview
This script is designed to demonstrate how to handle HTTP errors in Python using the `urllib` library. It takes a URL as input, sends a request to the URL, and displays the body of the response. If the request encounters an HTTP error, the script prints the error code.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of HTTP requests and error handling

## How to Use
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Save the script to a file, for example, `3-error_code.py`.
3. Run the script from the command line, passing the target URL as an argument.

   ```bash
   python3 3-error_code.py <URL>
   ```
